IMMORAL CONDUCT - ZDOOM EDITION
By Hellser
Original Mod By Cory Whittle

=========================================================================================
:INCOMING TRANSMISSION FROM CORY WHITTLE. DECEMBER 27th, 2002:

 Immoral Conduct is designed to be played either as is, or with any of your favorite
 wads. Immoral Conduct works just as well in Doom1 or Doom2, as well as Tnt or Plutonia.

 I recommend trying your luck at the Hell Revealed wads using Immoral Conduct, as well
 as Memento Mori 1 and 2, Requiem, Invasion 2, or any other level set you enjoy. Also
 works very well with 2002ado, Darken, Darken2, Icarus, Biowar, Phoenix, Phobos,
 Eternal Doom, Alien Vendetta, etc.
 Hell, it works with any Vanilla or "Lite" Boom level or level set.

 NOTE: Obviously works best with levels that DON'T use a lot of replacement sprites,
       such as Ultdtv.wad or similar. Definitely won't work with existing conversions
	   like Hacx or Strain, Aliens TC, etc.

:INCOMING TRANSMISSION FROM HELLSER, NOVEMBER 20th, 2014:

 I see that you wish to continue the work of Immoral Conduct, as made by Cory Whittle
 and to that, I thank you. The following list is the things that I've done. However,
 the decorate folder (actors) is a bit of a mess. I'll try to guide you.

 If you work on this, please include me in the credits. That'll mean a lot. For personal
 credits, I have to give credit to Ryan Cordell for the base actor code he taught me
 and Wild Weasel, for his [albeit modified] casing code.

 Most importantly as well - thank you everyone on the ZDoom Forums. Ya'll been amazing.

 Decorate Actors:

 actors/ammo						Various Ammos used in ICD-ZD, view ICD_AmmoTypes.txt
									for further information

 actors/core						Base actors and PlayerPawn. The base actors are used
									everywhere in the mod.

 actors/effects						Various effects such as bulletpuffs, smoke and
 									tracers

 actors/monsters					Do I need to tell you what this is?

 actors/other						Barrels, hell and tech world actors/objects

 actors/weapons						These things makes monsters dead.

 Sound Info:
